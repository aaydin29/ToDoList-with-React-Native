## ToDoList-with-React-Native
- Hello, I simply created a to-do list in this project.
- To save the to-do and print it to the screen, I stored the data I obtained with the Text Input in useState. 
- Then I printed the data I got from useState to the screen using FlatList.
- Also, by using the useState, I allowed the user to remove the to-dos that they want to remove by pressing the red cross.
- ***I will continue to develop the project.***
