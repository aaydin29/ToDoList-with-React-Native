## ToDoList-with-React-Native
- Hello, I simply created a to-do list in this project.
- To save the to-do and print it to the screen, I stored the data I obtained with the Text Input in useState. 
- Then I printed the data I got from useState to the screen using FlatList.
- Also, by using the useState, I allowed the user to remove the to-dos that they want to remove by pressing the red cross.
- ***I will continue to develop the project.***

## UPDATE
- A new page called Completed was created using **React Navigation** and **Bottom Tab Navigation**.
- Tasks completed using **React Redux** have been made readable from the Completed page.
- A completed button has been added next to the tasks we have added on the My Tasks page.
- A clear button has been added to the Completed page. Clicking this button deletes all tasks on the page. **Redux** was used to provide this functionality.
- Minor design changes have been made.
